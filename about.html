    <h1>Hlanganani Mentorship</h1>
    <h2>Established 2025</h2>
    <p>Hlanganani Mentorship is a digital-based trading education platform that exists solely online. We are not a physical institution or trading firm. Our services are built around accessibility, flexibility, and empowering individuals with the knowledge to approach Forex trading confidently and responsibly.</p>

    <p>We operate fully through digital channels including Telegram, WhatsApp, YouTube, and this website. All communication, mentorship sessions, resources, and support are delivered virtually.</p>

    <p>Our mentorship tiers provide structured guidance for all experience levels — from complete beginners to more advanced traders. We emphasize foundational understanding, responsible risk management, and continuous learning through live sessions, pre-recorded material, and one-on-one support (depending on the tier).</p>

    <div class="motto">"Bringing Traders Together, One Pip at a Time."</div>

    <p>We believe that with the right support, mindset, and mentorship, anyone can navigate the Forex market more confidently. Hlanganani Mentorship is here to walk the journey with you — not just as educators, but as a community that grows together.</p>
    <p>All inquiries or mentorship engagements are handled online. We do not promise profits or returns. Trading involves risk, and we exist to educate, not to manage funds or provide financial advice.</p>
